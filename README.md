# qm-evolution-closed
C++ program for calculating the time evolution of a closed and driven quantum system. The evolution is calculated using a 4th-order Trotter-Susuki algorithm, which preserves unitarity for arbitrary discretization of time.

The program is optimized for parameter iteration and the user can define the functions which are of interest to calculate.
